Merge makes a new commit on the CURRENT branch that brings in changes from a different branch. You take the content from the other branch and you add them to your working branch. The syntax for merge is git merge <branchtomergein>. The merge strategies are:  resolve, recursive, octopus, ours, and subtree. A merge conflict occurs when two people make changes to the same line in the same file at the same time or if one person deletes the file and other is modifying it.  To fix a conflict you can run “git status” and then check where the errors are. Open a text editor and remove the errors which are usually like: “<<<<<< HEAD” or “>>>>>>”. Then do git add . and then go ahead and continue.
